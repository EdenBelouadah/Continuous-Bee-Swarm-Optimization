# Continuous-Bee-Swarm-Optimization
## Abstract
Metaheuristics are generic algorithms, often bio-inspired, which aim to solve complex problems. Bee Swarm Optimization (BSO) is a metaheuristic proved efficient to handle some combinatorial optimization problems. The goal of this work is to adapt BSO to optimize functions with continuous variables. Hence, we have done it by redefining some basic concepts such as solution neighbourhood. The efficiency of our algorithm called Continuous Bee Swarm Optimization (CBSO) has been proved through a set of multi-modal functions for which minima are known.
